## What is this?

Wheel-Spinner Next looks and feels like a normal random picker, but under the hood it contains a covert control panel where organisers can **pre-select the next winner** (or a sequence of winners).

The public UI still animates, makes noise, and stops at apparently random segments. Only the trusted operator knows the outcome was locked in advance.

## Disclaimers & ethics

This project is for **educational and parody purposes**â€”demonstrating how seemingly fair randomisers can be manipulated. Do **not** use it to defraud, gamble, or run illicit raffles. Always disclose to participants when randomness is not genuine.
